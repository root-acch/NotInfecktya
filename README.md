# About

NotInfecktya is a modern cybersecurity solution to defend users and companies from ransomwaresüëæ, made totaly on windows kernel mode.
It counts with a beatiful graphical interface to show the informations for the users around start and stop the driver, open the backup 
folder(Notice that the driver have to be stopped to the user can recover their data), and be able to release the backup space from on disk.
If the company wants to do some programmatic operation on file system, they need to connect on driver and use the interface token, entering in
contact with our team we can provide some code for reference.
